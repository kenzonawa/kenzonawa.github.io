            <h4 style="margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;">What do you think were the intended goals of v2?</h4>

            <p>From what I saw in CMP Version 2, its intended goals were to 

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Make it cleaner by separating the outside image and the card text.</strong> Since the writers can only be working on either the image or the text, it makes logical sense to cut off what is not being currently used. </li>
                <br/>
                <li><strong>Make the text bigger and more legible.</strong> The writers use script fonts and these are harder to read than serif or sans-serif fonts. Expanding the screen makes it easier to read the text area.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
            <h2 class="designTitle">Design 1</h2>
            <p class="gifContainer">

            </p>
            <h3><i>Process</i></h3>
            <p>Writers are already accustomed to v1, which allows multiple window-screen viewing. This design is a step up from v1, but doesn’t have as drastic a change as v2. We can call it v1.5. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Users will continue to be able to display two cards as noted in the observations. The difference is that this design incorporates the intentions of v2. Instead of entirely separating the card image and text, this design increases the size of whichever the writer is working on and decreases the size of the other. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A different choice would have been to separate the card image and text with a flip button as will be shown in Design 2, but there is an unanswered question about the writers’ preference: Do they want the image and text to be shown at the same time, or is it OK that they’re separated? (more in the <i>Additional Questions</i> section)

                  <ul>
                  <li><strong>Focus Area</strong> - Writers can either work on the image or the text. Whichever they choose to work on, the respective part of the screen gets bigger and the other part, smaller. </li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><strong>Minimal adjustment</strong> - The writers can continue working as they used to, as the only additional feature is the focus area. This leads to the least amount of resistance to change by the users.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <h3><i>Process</i></h3>
            <p>This design is a lot similar to v2. The difference is that it incorporates the major user requirement that v2 missed: being able to look at two different cards at the same time. 
              <br/>
            <br/>
            CMP v2 had good intentions, but missed one key point, which made its users deem it “totally unusable” within a day. By fixing this key point, we get a fresh redesign that satisfies user needs.</p>

            <h3><i>Process</i></h3>
            <p>Design 1 and 2 have restrictions. Design 1 has pre-determined sizes to its focus area. Design 2 has a fixed card display amount of two (it will always display two cards). These restrictions come from a lack of control from the user, which results in a lack of customizability. Design 3 has the intended goal of giving control to users. In this way, writers will be able to resize all the elements of the card according to his/her will. </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 48px;">Additional Questions</h3>
            <p>These are questions that would need to be answered in order to design a better system:</p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
              <li><strong>Do writers agree with image and text separation?</strong> - CMP v2 separates both the image and the text, but what if having both in the same screen is a feature that users want? The image is just as much part of the card as the text in it, so it's important that the message sent by each is coherent.  </li>
            </br>
              <li><strong>Do writers ever open a third card?</strong> - From the observations, we gathered that looking at two different cards is essential for work. Do we need to worry about writers needing to open up an additional card? This could put a restriction on the designs we make. </li>
            </br>
              <li><strong>Do writers use other sources of inspirations(like websites) other than the archived cards?</strong> - If writers constantly look at websites to get inspiration, a full-screen application would be a hinderance to user experience. Once in a full-screen application, there is a notable delay when changing screens to another window. It's possible that a full-screen design is not a good path to take.  </li>
              
            </ul>

      <div class="section">
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 24px;margin-top: 48px;">My Design Choice</h3>
            <h4>For the APT Writers - Design 3</h4>
            <p>Assuming that writers are already comfortable with the window view since it’s used in v1, moving and resizing the card elements shouldn’t be a problem. With this, writers have full control of the size of the cards they use. This ability to customize to each writer’s preference makes Design 3, in my opinion, the best design for this scenario. 
            </br></br>
            The main advantage of Design 3 over Design 1 and 2 for APT writers is that since they’re familiar with window manipulation, it gives them control. Keeping in mind that these writers were frustrated with v2, which constrained them to a single full-screen card and contradicted their current behaviors, the more flexible and customizable the design, the higher the chance that it be accepted.
            </p>
            
            </br>
            <h4>For other potential populations - Design 1</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 48px;">Assuming that this potential population is not tech-savvy, Design 1 has the easiest and most natural interface. Opening up CMP will open one window with two parts: image and text. If the user wants to add an image, just click the image part and it’s done. If the user wants to write the card text, it’s just as simple. 
            </br></br>
            Design 2 would confuse users because of the split screen. A new user would probably see the two cards and have no idea what the second card is for. Furthermore, a new user wouldn’t have the behavior of looking at other cards for inspiration.
            </br></br>
            Design 3 might not be a good idea for non tech-savvy users. They probably wouldn’t understand the feature of moving and resizing the cards. If the users don’t know how to use a feature, it’s pretty much the same as not having it. The control handles that separate the image and text could also frustrate novice users if they didn’t figure out how to use them.
