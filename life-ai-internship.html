      <div>
        <p class="paragraph-4">During the summer of 2017, I worked as a UI/UX Design Intern at <a href="https://life.ai/" target="_blank">life.ai</a>. Working with a tightly-knit team of designer at a small, yet ambitious startup was an incredible experience. From having countless meetings discussing the product to designing its first version, we all went through and learned a lot in the 12 weeks that was this internship.<br><br>Since a lot of the work was done under an N.D.A., I will purposefully be vague on some points, but I have asked for and gotten permission to talk about and show a few things. I will start by talking briefly about the company, and will spend most of this story talking about what we did, what we achieved, and ultimately, what I learned over the course of this summer.</p>

      <div class="paragraph-div">
        <p class="paragraph-4">Before I talk about life.ai, let me tell you a bit about <a href="https://www.citylink.ai/" target="_blank">22 CityLink.</a> Their mission is to create a smart city, where everything is integrated and connected. They are the ones responsible for physically building the city. Life.ai, on the other hand, is the one responsible for making the city “smart”. In order to do this, the company has been developing an intelligent, adaptive system to learn from each individual to deliver an exceptional citizen-centric experience.</p><img src="images/Gramercy.jpg" srcset="images/Gramercy-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/Gramercy-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/Gramercy-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/Gramercy-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, images/Gramercy.jpg 3191w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 640px">

      <div>
        <p class="paragraph-4">As of summer 2017, the company had a good grasp of the back-end technology that would drive the intelligent system. However, there was no actual product to use it. I was hired along with <a href="https://www.chrismackintosh.work/" target="_blank">Chris Mackintosh</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cthrp" target="_blank">Coleman Tharp</a>, <a href="https://tre.gg/" target="_blank">Tregg Frank</a>, and <a href="https://www.mingchucong.com/" target="_blank">Mingchu Cong</a> to design a mobile app that would be the core of what the smart city citizens would use.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-div">
        <p class="paragraph-4">While getting onboarded into the company, we all got a pretty good idea of what was envisioned as the life.ai product. An assistant like Siri and Alexa that would help the smart city citizens do whatever they wanted to get done as conveniently as possible. This personal assistant would help you do things like buy tickets or find the best restaurant for you to go eat right now. All within the limits of the smart-city.</p>

        <h3 class="project-section-subtitle">Conversation as interaction</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-div">
        <p class="paragraph-4">Our first big challenge was designing a Conversational UI. As designers, we are used to creating static screens and having clearly defined actions in each screen. But how the heck do you design a conversation? There are a million possible ways to talk about one thing. <br><br>We started off by creating functionality for a few specific tasks that we decided were important. Before designing screens, we made conversation flows that would lay the foundation as to what scenario we were designing for.</p>

      <div class="paragraph-div">
        <p class="paragraph-4">Whenever the assistant detected an intent from the user (e.g. the intent to buy a train ticket), the conversational flow for that particular task would start. <strong>This is basically how Conversational UI differed from conventional UI.</strong> Instead of having a button that would take you through a user flow, you would express your intent and go through a sequence of interactions to ultimately achieve the task at hand.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="paragraph-div">
            <p class="paragraph-4">Since everything was inside the scope of a conversation, we needed a way to make content interactable and dynamic. We found cards to be the catch-all solution because it fits naturally in the conversation flow and you can put lots of content in it.</p>

      <h2 class="project-section">Getting everyone on the same page</h2>
      <div>
        <h3 class="project-section-subtitle">The first big hurdle</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-div">
        <p class="paragraph-4">Given that this was the first design push of the company, there was not a clearly defined way to move with things. We ran into many obstacles as we tried to build a product for the company. One of the biggest hurdles I remember happened when I presented the design of a feature I’d been working on. <br><br>Since we (the interns) were only there for the summer, we had a limited time to come up with the first version of the product. The fastest way to do that was for each designer to take a core feature and design it. I was definitely excited about this. Ever since my past employment at JP Morgan, I’d always been keen on having quick and objective deliveries. Within a few days, I proudly told everybody I was ready to show what I’d made. <br><br>This review session hit me in the head like a brick. After I presented my design, I quickly learnt that I hadn’t gotten input from the one most important stakeholder of the company. What to me looked like a decent, shippable feature was in fact missing the point and not really working well within the context. <br><br>Feeling quite down after this, I thought to myself that this could all have been avoided if only the CEO were more in-the-loop beforehand. Realizing that my colleagues were also going down the same road I was and that there were still other features left to design, I seized this opportunity to talk to the CEO about this before it got out of hand. We decided that before kickstarting the design of a feature, we would all have an ideation session with him to define the specific functionalities that each feature would have. <br><br>This helped all of us in narrowing down exactly what scenarios were important and what exactly we needed to design. By having this conversation early on, we also had a point of reference to go back to in case there was any divergence of opinion later down the road. In essence, we had buy-in from everyone at the start that this is what was going to be built. <br><br>In hindsight, not having started like this looks like such an amateur error, but at that moment, it all felt like we were getting so much done. Getting everyone on the same page was an important step that we were all overlooking. I’m glad I was the one to hit my head against this brick wall because it taught me to value communication and allowed my colleagues to get a heads up before they moved on with their work.</p>

      <h2 class="project-section">Design Tools</h2>
      <div>
        <h3 class="project-section-subtitle">What we used</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-div">
        <p class="paragraph-4">We went through two big phases with our design tools over the summer. We started off using <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> as our main design and collaboration tool. Figma enabled us to work concurrently on the same file and this was great at the start when we were laying the groundwork for how everything should look. We had sessions where we jointly designed how things like filters and categories should look like. Figma also made it easy for dev handoff. Since it’s a web based application, all our developers needed to do was click on the link to the Figma file and they could explore the designs and see their specs. </p>
        <div class="paragraph-image"><img src="images/Artboard-3.png" width="385.5" srcset="images/Artboard-3-p-500.png 500w, images/Artboard-3.png 771w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 385.5px" class="center-image">
          <p class="tags image-caption">Figma - 2 designers on the same file!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph-4">Although having many great benefits, Figma was getting us frustrated with frequent crashes and a subpar speed performance. Once we finished with the design foundations for the app and were about to start doing work on features separately, we decided to switch to <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a>. <br><br>Sketch by itself will only get you so far, but the beauty of it is that you can integrate it with so many other tools. We used <a href="https://www.goabstract.com/" target="_blank">Abstract</a> to have a central repository of all the Sketch files, as well as have version control for whenever someone was working on a file. We used <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/craft" target="_blank">Craft</a> by inVision to create a library from where we could drag and drop premade components(the ones we defined together in Figma). And we used <a href="https://zeplin.io/" target="_blank">Zeplin</a> to document the design specs to send to our developers. <br><br>To create our prototypes, we were really excited to use <a href="https://framer.com/" target="_blank">Framer</a> and we used it for some time. You get a very robust and dynamic prototype with Framer. However, the time investment on making these prototypes are high. We eventually got to a point where we weren’t seeing our return on investment for the quick little prototypes we needed. In the end, we switched to <a href="http://principleformac.com/" target="_blank">Principle</a> because we could make our prototypes so much faster and they didn’t need to simulate complex tasks.</p>

        <h3 class="project-section-subtitle">Having one unified design</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-div">
        <p class="paragraph-4">One big part of creating a new product for a company was also documenting our design decisions as we made them. This would not only help those that came after us, but it would make our backbone structure when creating new designs. I can’t count how many times we ran into differently sized buttons in our review/feedback sessions. </p>
        <div class="paragraph-image"><img src="images/Artboard-2.png" srcset="images/Artboard-2-p-500.png 500w, images/Artboard-2-p-800.png 800w, images/Artboard-2-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Artboard-2-p-1600.png 1600w, images/Artboard-2.png 1632w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 640px" class="image-10">
          <p class="tags image-caption">Our design system</p>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph-4">We achieved this in two ways: through Craft’s library feature in Sketch and the draft of a design system (kind of like Lightning). <br><br>Craft allowed us to make symbols that were synced in all of our files. So for example, we created a symbol for our primary button and put it into the library. Now, whenever we wanted to put a primary button in our designs, all we had to do was fetch it from the library and put it in. Oh by the way, whenever we wanted to update the button, it would update wherever it had been used. How were we designing as a team without this in the first place?<br><br>As we built the product, we also documented everything in our design system. Creating an entire website just to document all of our design decisions was a big task for such a small team. We found <a href="https://docsify.js.org/" target="_blank">Docsify</a>, which enabled us to use MarkDown files and create a website with a lot of ease. Whenever we arrived at a final decision on what a component looks like (such as cards), we updated the design system. This allowed us all to be in sync on what more complex components should look like (cards could look different, so the Craft library wasn’t a good option).</p>

        <p class="paragraph-4">This internship exposed me to so much, I’m sure I left more mature than I’d come in.
