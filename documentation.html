<strong><u><h3>Design Process</h3></u></strong><br>

<strong><u>Finalizing the Theme:</u></strong><br>
<ul>As a team, we first divided the ACS table variables among ourselves and started to examine those variables. <br>Then we brainstormed our ideas based on the selected variables and ended up with a theme for our project <strong>Life Style, Education and Transport Distribution.</strong><br>

<strong>Life Style:</strong> The following aspects are covered in this part <br>
Overall age distribution<br>
Overall sex distribution<br>
Overall Living Style Distribution<br>

<strong>Education:</strong> The following types are covered in this part<br>
Overall Distribution for graduate students with the following privilege:<br>
Born in State of Residence<br>
Born in Other states <br>
Native born but outside US<br>
Foreign Born<br>
<strong>Transport:</strong>The following features are covered in this part<br>
Different means of Transport Distribution:<br>
Car Alone, Carpooled, Public transports, Taxicabs, motorcycle, bicycle, Walk, others and working from home.<br>
Different commute time to Work Distribution:<br>
Less than 5 min, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, etc. more than 90 mins.</ul><br>
<strong><u>Finalizing the Layout:</u></strong><br>
<ul>Based on the requirements of the project, we organized the Design elements as followed.<br>
1.The Title:This element covers the heading for our project home page.<br>
2.The Selection Bar:This has all the selection options required for manipulating the visualization.<br>
<ul>1.A combo box to choose different variables.<br>
2.An option box to toggle between state or county. (Later we changed it to buttons due to technical difficult)<br>
3.Another box enclosing a button and 2 combo boxes to use it in the scatter plot<br>
4.Link to heat map page <br>
5.Link to Documentation page</ul><br><br>
3.The Map area: The choropleth for the selected (non related variables e.g. sex distribution and age distribution) variables will get displayed here.<br>
4.Pie Chart area: The overall distribution of different related variables (e.g. Living alone, living with relatives, living with child etc. will get displayed on a pie chart.<br>
5.Scatter Plot area: Here the users are given an option that they can choose 2 variables and view the relationship between them.<br>
6.Distributed Charts area: Here either a specific variable distribution across the states of the country is displayed in a bar chart or multiple charts are displayed for each state the user clicks on the choropleth.<br>
7.Heat Map page: This page displays eight types heat maps for the following options<br>
Total Population<br>
Loneliness (18-34;35-64;65+)<br>
Foreigners<br>
Education details</ul><br>
<strong><u>Rationale of our design choices:</u></strong><br>
<ul><strong>1.Combo box for selection: </strong>This option provides users an easy way to choose the option and it will not clutter the area since it auto collapses once the user has completed his/her selection.<br>
<strong>2.Map area and Pie chart/Scatterplot area side by side:</strong> This way the users can see the the overall distribution of a specific category on the choropleth map and when they hover over the states they can view the category distribution on the pie chart. They can also compare 2 variables in the scatterplot and click a point on the plot to highlight a state on the choropleth map.<br>

<strong>3.Heat Map on a separate page: </strong>Moving the heat map to another page gives the users the freedom to explore it freely without any spacial constraints.<br>

<strong>4.Distribution Maps at the bottom:</strong>
Here bar charts for variables that needs a comparative study can be viewed here. We kept it at the bottom to give the users the freedom to view multiple state charts all at a time.</ul> <br><br>

    <strong><u>How we used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions we had.</u></strong> <br>

<ul><strong>Understanding the Life Style in US:</strong><br>
1.	How young or old a state is in terms of people who live there?<br>

2.	How individualistic the society is? How much people are sharing their lives with other people? Are people are living in groups?<br>
<img src="loneliness.png" alt="Akon" style="width:300px;height:300px;"><br/>
We have found that interestingly, there is a relation between the percentage of people who live alone, and the amount of foreigners there are in a particular state. As you can see in the above scatterplot, there is a trend for loneliness to lower as the amount of foreigners rise. That could mean a number of things including foreigners being more open and seeking for romantic partners for a green card.</br>
</br><strong>Understanding overall professional Education dispersion:</strong><br>
3.	How educated the society is in terms of professional degrees<br> 
</br><strong>Understanding what their daily commute is like:</strong><br>
4.	What means of transportation people use to commute?<br>
5.	How Long they will take to Commute to work?<br> </ul>
