# What is this repository?
This is where I host most of my personal and class projects. Feel free to browse around.

I recommend checking out my [CrunchBase project](https://kenzonawa.github.io/project3/) on startups. 

If you've seen 24do, you can also check out the landing page I created [here](https://kenzonawa.github.io/24do/)
